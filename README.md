# 1730-Project-3
**Group Members**
- Joeseph Fritz
- Mason Protsman
- Andrew Phipps

**Contributions**\
Each problem/program and their solutions were discussed by the entire group before being completed. Each member of the group hashed out ideas and shared code on every program. We discussed which system calls would be appropriate for each of the problems. Once we felt like we knew what we needed to do for each problem the person chosen to submit the project (Andrew Phipps) typed out the final implementation, asking for suggestions and referring to the other group members' code (and the previous project's code) when needed.

**Instructions**
- Compiling: To compile type: "make" or "g++ -o filename filename.cpp"
